in philosophy a causal chain is an ordered sequence of events in which any one event in the chain causes the next some philosopherswho believe causation relates facts not events in which case the meaning is adjusted accordingly some philosopherswho believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type that is the massenergy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic pattern where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury say there may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists the fact that certain events seem to cause other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the massenergy that exists in spacetime which is ultimately either due or an instantiation of the laws of physics note stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading as one would have to define what is meant by causality  it may be that causality is dependent upon counterfactual definiteness that is a causes b because if a did not occur then b would not occur ie a is necessary for b and because a is sufficient for b it may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept if one rejects counterfactual definiteness for instance but that causal chains are still a valid concept as they would merely be chains of events

the japanese friendship garden also known as san kei en    is a japanese garden within balboa park san diego it is an expression of friendship between san diego and its sister city yokohama that binds the two cultures to create a unique experience for visitors from all over the world representing a new concept in the development of a japanese garden outside japan the japanese friendship garden is designed to present an atmosphere of elegant simplicity shibui and quiet beauty the design is guided by the original principles of the japanese garden while incorporating elements of the regional landscape and climate a garden is always in a state of change but the basic elements of trees shrubs rocks and water designed in natural balance create a peaceful harmonious and transcendental environment conducive to contemplation and meditation   in balboa park the year  san diego opened its panamacalifornia exposition designed to call attention to san diego and bolster the economy the exposition highlighted archaeological and anthropological displays as well as advertised the agricultural potential of the southwest one of the popular exhibits was a japanese teahouse built just north of the botanical building in an area that is now occupied by the childrens zoo the teahouse was a onestory building with an open veranda where visitors to the exposition could sit sip tea and enjoy a garden landscaped in a manner few had seen other than from photos of japan there was a japanese garden adjacent to the teahouse which could be described as plants stone lanterns bronze cranes and a winding stream squeezed into a small space so small that everything was foreground while the garden lacked a sense of depth or borrowing of scenery shakkei details were carefully executed by the gardeners who were well versed in the techniques of bonsai and ikebana the overall harmony of elements was sacriced as effects were compressed for space in japan there are often fences or walls surrounding the garden but in balboa park at that time there was neither fence nor wall to help create and dene areas or moods for nearly  years the teahouse and garden were operated and maintained by the asakawa family who continue to this day as active members of the san diego community though a symbol of the strong cultural and commercial ties that linked the two nations the teahouse and garden were eventually closed after the world exposition the city was not going to pay to upkeep and maintain the garden so they looked for a japanese couple to run the tea house some of my earliest memories was painting the bridges every three years with red paint taking down the shoji screens and replacing them with rice paper around the garden was also a chore of my fondest memories of the tea house was one of peace nice and quiet surrounded by lush trees i enjoyed living there growing up as the eldest child of three my parents used to harvest bamboo shoots when they grew to be about twelve inches tall and prepared them for food the living quarters consisted of two bedrooms and one bathroom an attic upstairs the tea house was opened to the public the customers of the japanese tea house enjoyed their tea sandwiches ham and chicken salad and noodles around porch that surrounded the tea house inside you would find tatami mats traditional flooring of japan made of bamboo visitors could also find one of a kind gifts that his parents imported from japan i believed that my mother was accredited to being the first to incorporate green tea powder with ice cream more of my recollections were of the koi pond it contained  koi and the famous wisteria arbors i remember a professional japanese photographer asking my mother to pose for him in front of the wisteria the photo is now known as the wisteria photo after the photographer returned back to his homeland he blossomed into a very prominent photographer from  through  the japanese tea garden remained the same until it was dismantledmoto asakawa in  key citizens of san diego gathered and formulated a plan for restoring a japanese garden in balboa park on an expanded site as the rst tangible symbol of this effort the city of yokohama presented the city of san diego with a snow lantern in  following that in  they presented the friendship bell which can now be found on shelter island the san diego yokohama sister city society whose members worked with the city of san diego to identify the current site of the garden acquired a japanese gate they installed it just to the north of the organ pavilion in  they dedicated the gate as the charles c dail memorial japanese gate in order to honor the commitment by the people of san diego the gate was near the entrance to the  acres  ha set aside in balboa park the eventual construction and restoration site of a japanese garden in  after hearing the plans by many san diegans to reestablish a japanese garden yokohama gave san diego  cherry blossom trees that now blossom at the wild animal park during  and  a series of public conferences were held to make plans for the new garden these events allowed the general public to get involved in the designing of balboas new garden the next step was to design a master plan for this task the society called upon the architectural rm of fong  larocca associates takeo uesugi the landscape architect and japanese garden design consultant was to help them in planning and designing the garden in  the department of parks  recreation and the city councils public facilities  recreation committee approved the japanese garden master plan for balboa park the society had a professional feasibility study completed to determine if sufficient nancial support was available not only did funds have to be identied from san diego but also from a sources throughout the united states and japan the study showed that support for the project was strong so with the cooperation of mayor pete wilson and the city of san diego the new japanese friendship garden was under way in  landscape architect takeshi ken nakajima named the garden sankeien which means garden of three types of scenerypastoral mountain and lake the initial master plan was designed so that garden could be constructed in five phases with the rst opening in august  while planning for the second phase the master plan was changed and the phase system was discontinued in september  a major improvement project was completed the design team for this project was led by landscape architect professor takeo uesugi the improvement project included the improvement project took two years of planning the garden was closed to the public for approximately six months and reopened september   coordinates n w  n w   

in archeology cliff dwellings are dwellings formed by using niches or caves in high cliffs with more or less excavation or with additions in the way of masonry two special sorts of cliff dwelling are distinguished by archaeologists the cliffhouse which is actually built on levels in the cliff and the cavate which is dug out by using natural recesses or openings rockcut architecture generally refers to rather grander temples but also tombs cut into living rock although for example the ajanta caves in india of the nd century bce to th century ce probably housed several hundred buddhist monks and are cut into a cliff as are the mogao caves in china some of the most famous cliff dwellings are those in north america particularly among the canyons of the southwest in arizona new mexico utah colorado and chihuahua in mexico some of which are still used by native americans there has been considerable discussion as to their antiquity but modern research finds no definite justification for assigning them to a distinct primitive race or farther back than the ancestors of the modern pueblo peoplecitation needed the area in which they occur coincides with that in which other traces of the pueblo tribes have been found the niches that were used are often of considerable size occurring in cliffs to a thousand feet in height and approached by rock steps or log ladders

alexander montgomerie c  scottish jacobean courtier and poet or makar born in ayrshire he was one of the principal members of the castalian band a circle of poets in the court of james vi in the s which included the king himself montgomerie was for a time in favour as one of the kings favourites he was a catholic in a largely protestant court and his involvement in political controversy led to his expulsion as an outlaw in the mids montgomeries poetry much of which examines themes of love includes autobiographical sonnets and foreshadows the later metaphysical poets in england he is sometimes by tradition given the epithet captain   montgomerie was a younger son of the ayrshire laird hugh montgomerie of hessilhead d  and so was related to the earl of eglinton and a distant relation of james vi nothing is known for certain about his life before about  but contemporary or nearcontemporary accounts suggest that he was brought up as a member of the church of scotland spent some time in argyll before leaving for the continent and was converted to catholicism in spain he probably saw active service as a soldier for the scottish forces in the netherlands in the later s although there is no certain documentary evidence of this montgomeries arrival in edinburgh may have been linked in some way to that of the kings catholic frenchborn kinsman esm stewart whose ascendancy at court coincides with the period of the poets greatest prominence  it is likely that his earliest surviving poems are the navigation and the related cartel of the thre ventrous knichts which may well have been written for performance at court at epiphany  he came to prominence as laureled leader of the castalian band a circle of court poets headed by the king after being declared victor over a rival poet patrick hume of polwarth in a comically scurrilous flyting or poetic duel the king who was himself a practising member of the group referred to montgomerie as its maister poete a number of montgomeries poems can be assigned to the first half of the s including sonnets court songs and the first unfinished version of his longest work the allegorical cherrie and the slae like some other pieces it may have been written at least in part by autumn  for the yearold king included a passage from it in his literary manifesto some reulis and cautelis to be observit and eschewit in scottis poesie published around september of that year as early as  july  montgomerie was granted a pension by the king drawn from the revenues of glasgow cathedral his career had evidently survived the temporary imprisonment of james by a militant protestant faction led by the earl of gowrie and the exile and death of esm stewart whom james had made duke of lennox but there seems to have been a fundamental change in the culture of the court towards the end of  when the king took personal control of the government and in the summer of  montgomerie joined an enlarged scottish contingent fighting for the dutch republic against the spanish he stayed there for more than two years serving at zutphen at the same time as the unfortunate sir philip sidney and eventually experiencing severe financial difficulties as a result of nonpayment by the dutch authorities he eventually struck a deal with the states of holland in february  and was back in scotland by the end of the year life at court was now very different from what it had been before montgomeries departure not least because of justified allegations of intrigue between leading catholic aristocrats and the spanish on a more personal level the poets pension had been claimed by someone else during his absence and a long legal struggle ended in defeat for montgomerie in july  this battle produced some of his most remarkable poetry increasingly embittered sonnets encouraging cajoling and eventually attacking the judges and lawyers involved and even the king himself at the same time he continued to write formal poems about life at court while some undated songs and other verses may well also come from this period mongomerie largely disappears from view after the collapse of his legal case until he became involved in late  or early  in a catholic plot to seize the rocky outcrop of ailsa craig in the lower firth of clyde as support for a spanish intervention in the earl of tyrones rebellion in ireland led by montgomeries friend and fellowpoet hugh barclay of ladyland this enterprise soon collapsed barclay being killed in the process and on  july  montgomerie was declared an outlaw he may have planned to leave the country perhaps to go to the scottish benedictine monastery in wrzburg but he was still in scotland at the time of his death in august  his death proved as controversial as much of his life for the authorities of the canongate kirk in edinburgh refused to allow him to be buried in the churchyard on the grounds of his catholicism only an intervention by the king himself forcing them to change their minds montgomeries exact place of burial is unknown but it must have been in the church or grounds of holyrood abbey which was then used by the canongate congregation montgomeries poetic output of over  pieces is mostly known from just one witness the ker manuscript presented to edinburgh university library by the poet william drummond of hawthornden it is possible that this was assembled from montgomeries papers soon after his death it must in any case have been written soon afterwards the range of his work is extensive from elegant court songs including lyk as the dum solsequium and melancholie grit deput of dispair to the bitter sometimes contorted wordplay of the sonnets associated with the dispute over his pension from witty pieces addressed to the king to the profound religious sensibility of a godly prayer and the extraordinary come my childrene dere montgomerie is one of the finest of middle scots poets and perhaps the greatest scottish exponent of the sonnet form although the twentiethcentury poets robert garioch and edwin morgan were also fine sonnetteers the cherrie and the slae which he probably revised and completed shortly before his death is an ambitious religious allegory employing a demanding lyrical stanza form which suggests that it was intended for singing despite its considerable length his poetry reaches back to the earlier makars henryson dunbar and doouglas but he also translates from clment marot and from ronsard and some of his work invites comparison with baroque writers such as marino gngora donne and herbert the text of the frontispieces of three early imprints of works by montgomerie run as follows
